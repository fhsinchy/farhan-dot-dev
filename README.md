# farhan.dev — Automated Engineering Insights

> _I build scalable backends and AI systems — and share how they work._

---

### 💡 What This Is

**farhan.dev** is a fully automated content platform that publishes short, high-signal insights (“nuggets”) on **backend** and **AI engineering**.

Each nugget is generated by AI, reviewed by me, and published through a hands-free CI/CD workflow.  
The result: a living portfolio that demonstrates both my **technical expertise** and **engineering writing craft** — without manual overhead.

### ⚙️ Stack & Architecture

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Framework | [Astro](https://astro.build) + MDX + Tailwind |
| Hosting | [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) |
| AI Engine | [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers) + OpenAI |
| Storage | Workers KV for idea/state management |
| Automation | Cloudflare Workers (scheduled triggers) |
| Search & Comments | Fuse.js + Giscus |

The pipeline looks like this:

```
Idea (JSON) → AI Worker → GitHub PR → Review → Merge → Deploy
```

Once merged, Cloudflare Pages redeploys instantly, publishing a new nugget to [farhan.dev](https://farhan.dev/).
