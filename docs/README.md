## 🧠 Philosophy

The documentation aims to be **transparent**, **minimal**, and **educational** — demonstrating how backend and AI automation can coexist cleanly in a personal publishing system.

It’s designed to show both **technical rigor** and **content craftsmanship** — blending automation, writing, and infrastructure into one cohesive platform.
