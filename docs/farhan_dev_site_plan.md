**farhan.dev Relaunch Plan — Backend & AI Engineering Nugget Platform**

---

## 1. Vision & Positioning

**Goal:** Build farhan.dev into a lightweight, automated hub of short, high-impact **backend and AI engineering** insights ("nuggets") that showcase Farhan Hasin Chowdhury’s engineering expertise and technical writing credibility while requiring minimal maintenance.

**Tagline:** "I build scalable backends and AI systems — and share how they work."

**Value Proposition:** Concise, high-signal lessons from real backend **and AI engineering** experience, generated and curated by AI, reviewed by Farhan.

## 2. Architecture Overview

**Stack:**
- Framework: **Astro** (MDX-first, islands architecture, great for static sites)
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages (free)
- Functions: Cloudflare Workers (search, cron, newsletter sync)
- Content Source: MDX files auto-generated by OpenAI API via GitHub Action
- Search: Fuse.js client-side search (free, static)
- Comments: Giscus (GitHub Discussions)
- Analytics: Cloudflare Web Analytics
- Newsletter: Substack or Buttondown (free tier)

**Repository Structure:**
```
/content/nuggets/        # Generated nuggets (MDX)
/ideas/                  # YAML idea seeds
/scripts/                # Generation & QA scripts
/components/             # Custom MDX components
/public/                 # Static assets
```  

**Workflow:**
1. New idea added as `/ideas/topic.yml`.
2. GitHub Action triggers OpenAI API script.
3. Nugget generated as MDX + committed to `/content/nuggets/`.
4. Cloudflare Pages rebuilds automatically.
5. Newsletter and LinkedIn posts auto-generated from same content.

## 3. Content Philosophy

**Format:** 150–300 words per nugget.
- **Context:** One-sentence setup.
- **Insight:** 3–5 bullets or short paragraphs.
- **Code/Diagram:** Optional, up to 20 LOC or 1 diagram.
- **Apply It:** 1–2 actionable bullets.

**Voice:** Experienced engineer talking to peers. Direct, confident, and grounded in real work.

**Tags:** microservices, reliability, api-design, scaling, infra, **ai-engineering**, llm, rag, vector-search, evaluation, prompt-engineering, devops.

## 5A. Editorial Workflow (Option A — Pre-merge Review)

**Goal:** Ensure every nugget is reviewed before it goes live, without slowing down automation.

### Roles
- **Generator Bot (GH Action):** Converts `/ideas/*.yml` → `/content/nuggets/*.mdx`, opens a PR.
- **Critic Bot (optional):** Leaves a comment with accuracy/style checks.
- **Reviewer (You):** Skim + edit in GitHub UI, then merge.

### Branch Strategy
- Default branch: `main` (protected)
- Working branch per batch: `nuggets/<YYYY-MM-DD>-batch`

### PR Template (add to `.github/pull_request_template.md`)
```

```

### Branch Protection (GitHub → Settings → Branches)
- Require PR review from code owners (add yourself under `CODEOWNERS`).
- Require status checks to pass (build succeeds, lint).
- Dismiss stale reviews on new commits.

### Preview Builds
- Enable preview deployments for PRs (Cloudflare Pages → your project → Git integration → *Preview builds on PRs*). Reviewer checks the live preview before merge.

### Merge → Publish → Cross-post
1. **Merge PR** to `main`.
2. Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys (production).
3. `socialify` script runs (optional Action) to produce LinkedIn draft text + image card.
4. Approve/schedule the LinkedIn posts in Buffer/Typefully.

## 8. Growth & Analytics

**Metrics to Track:**
- Pageviews per nugget (Cloudflare Analytics)
- LinkedIn impressions and saves
- Newsletter signups (Buttondown/Substack)
- Search queries (Fuse.js analytics log)

**Quarterly Review:**
- Identify top 5 nuggets by engagement.
- Repurpose into: mini video explainer, carousel, or longform post.

---

## 9. Long-Term Extensions

- Add **semantic search** (Typesense + pgvector) later.
- Add **AI Q&A sidebar** ("Ask this article") powered by local embeddings.
- Launch **free micro-course** ("15 Backend Patterns in 15 Days").
- Introduce guest nuggets from peers or open-source collaborators.

---

**Outcome:** A self-sustaining, automated, high-signal platform that demonstrates Farhan’s backend expertise, grows audience reach, and attracts both employers and writing partners.
